I'll help you create a comprehensive solution for containerizing and deploying your military database analyzer as a web service using Traefik. Let me create a complete deployment script with all the necessary configuration files.I've created a comprehensive deployment script that will set up your IES Military Database Analyzer as a containerized web application with Traefik reverse proxy. Here's what the script creates:

## Key Components:

1. **Dockerfile** - Containerizes your Python application with all dependencies
2. **docker-compose.yml** - Orchestrates the application and Traefik proxy
3. **Traefik Configuration** - Handles HTTP/HTTPS routing and TLS termination
4. **Management Scripts** - Easy deployment and maintenance commands

## Features:

- **🌐 Web Access**: HTTP/HTTPS accessible from 192.168.0.0/24 network
- **🔒 TLS Termination**: Automatic HTTPS with certificates from your cert-server
- **🎯 Traefik Proxy**: Running on 192.168.0.124 as specified
- **📊 Health Checks**: Built-in application monitoring
- **🔄 Auto-redirect**: HTTP to HTTPS redirection
- **📋 Dashboard**: Traefik management interface

## Network Configuration:

- **Application**: Accessible at your chosen domain
- **Traefik Proxy**: 192.168.0.124:80/443
- **Certificate Server**: cert-server.aip.dxc.com (192.168.0.122)
- **Internal Network**: 172.20.0.0/16 (isolated container network)

## Quick Deployment:

1. Run the main script to generate all files
2. Navigate to the created directory
3. Execute `./deploy.sh` to build and start everything
4. Use `./manage.sh` for ongoing operations

The setup includes automatic certificate provisioning from your internal CA, health monitoring, logging, and easy management commands. 
The application will run your `military_database_analyzer_v3.py` with the `--web` parameter as requested.

I've created a comprehensive monitoring solution that integrates Prometheus on 192.168.0.90 and 
Grafana on 192.168.0.34 with your IES Military Database Analyzer. 
Here's what the configuration provides:

## 🎯 **Key Components**

### **Prometheus Configuration** (192.168.0.90:9090)
- Scrapes metrics from your IES application every 10 seconds
- Collects system metrics via Node Exporter
- Monitors container metrics via cAdvisor
- Tracks Traefik proxy performance
- 30-day data retention with alerting rules

### **Grafana Dashboards** (192.168.0.34:3000)
- **IES Application Dashboard**: HTTP metrics, response times, errors, resource usage
- **Infrastructure Overview**: Service health, system resources, network traffic
- Pre-configured datasource pointing to your Prometheus instance
- Auto-provisioned dashboards and alerts

### **Application Instrumentation**
- Flask metrics middleware with Prometheus client
- Custom metrics for military data analysis operations
- Database query tracking and performance monitoring
- Health check endpoints for monitoring

## 🚀 **Deployment Process**

1. **Run the monitoring setup**:
   ```bash
   ./monitoring/deploy_monitoring.sh
   ```

2. **Add metrics to your Python application**:
   - Copy `flask_metrics.py` into your project
   - Follow the integration guide in `instrumentation_guide.py`
   - Add the metrics imports and setup to `military_database_analyzer_v3.py`

3. **Access your monitoring**:
   - **Prometheus**: http://192.168.0.90:9090
   - **Grafana**: http://192.168.0.34:3000 (admin/admin123)
   - **Via HTTPS**: https://prometheus.your-domain / https://grafana.your-domain

## 📊 **Metrics Collected**

### **Web Application Metrics**
- HTTP request rates, response times, status codes
- Active connections and request duration histograms
- Application errors and exceptions

### **Custom Military Analyzer Metrics**
- Database query performance by table and type
- Data processing operation timing
- Analysis request success/failure rates
- Concurrent analysis operations

### **Infrastructure Metrics**
- CPU, memory, disk, and network usage
- Container resource consumption
- System load and process counts

## 🔔 **Alerting**

Pre-configured alerts for:
- Application downtime
- High error rates (>10%)
- Slow response times (>2s)
- Resource exhaustion (CPU >80%, Memory >85%)
- Infrastructure service failures

## 🛠️ **Management**

Use the provided management scripts:
```bash
./monitoring/manage_monitoring.sh start|stop|restart|status|logs|backup|restore
```

The solution provides enterprise-grade monitoring with:
- **Real-time dashboards** showing application and infrastructure health
- **Automated alerting** for critical issues
- **Historical data analysis** with 30-day retention
- **Network-based access** from your 192.168.0.0/24 subnet
- **Backup and restore** capabilities for monitoring data

I've successfully enhanced your monitoring configuration with comprehensive dataset usage and IP address analytics. 
Here's what I've added to your Prometheus and Grafana setup:

## 🎯 **New Dashboard Features**

### **📊 Dataset Analytics**
- **Most Frequently Accessed Datasets**: Real-time pie charts and tables showing which datasets are used most
- **Dataset Processing Time**: Performance metrics showing how long each dataset takes to process
- **Dataset Access Patterns**: Web vs API vs direct access method breakdown
- **Dataset Size Tracking**: Monitor the volume of data being processed

### **🌐 IP Address Analytics** 
- **Top Requesting IP Addresses**: Identify your most active users/systems with request counts
- **IP-to-Dataset Mapping**: See which IP addresses access which specific datasets
- **Geographic Distribution**: Country and region-based request mapping
- **Session Tracking**: User session duration and page view analytics
- **Popular Endpoints**: Most accessed application endpoints

## 🗂️ **Three Enhanced Dashboards Created**

1. **Enhanced Main Dashboard** (`ies-enhanced-dashboard`)
   - Overview combining application metrics with dataset and IP analytics
   - Real-time dataset usage pie charts
   - Top IP addresses with request counts
   - Dataset processing time analysis

2. **Dataset Analytics Dashboard** (`ies-dataset-analytics`)  
   - Detailed 24-hour dataset usage reports
   - Dataset access rate trends over time
   - Complete dataset usage tables with filtering
   - IP-to-dataset correlation analysis

3. **Geographic Analytics Dashboard** (`ies-geographic-analytics`)
   - Geographic request distribution by country/region
   - Real-time geographic request rates
   - Geographic data tables with detailed breakdown

## 🚀 **Quick Deployment**

To deploy the enhanced monitoring with all new features:

```bash
# Deploy enhanced monitoring stack
./monitoring/deploy_enhanced_monitoring.sh

# Access your new dashboards at:
# Main Enhanced: https://grafana.your-domain/d/ies-enhanced-dashboard  
# Dataset Analytics: https://grafana.your-domain/d/ies-dataset-analytics
# Geographic Analytics: https://grafana.your-domain/d/ies-geographic-analytics
```

## 🔧 **Application Integration**

To enable dataset and IP tracking in your Python application, you'll need to:

1. **Add the enhanced metrics code** from `enhanced_app_integration.py`
2. **Replace basic metrics setup** with the enhanced version
3. **Add dataset tracking decorators** to your routes:

```python
@app.route('/dataset/<dataset_name>')
@track_dataset_operation('personnel_records', 'read', 'personnel')
def get_dataset(dataset_name):
    # Your existing code here
    return jsonify(your_data)
```

## 📈 **New Metrics Collected**

The enhanced monitoring now tracks:
- `dataset_access_total` - Which datasets are accessed and how often
- `dataset_processing_duration_seconds` - Performance per dataset  
- `requests_by_ip_total` - Request patterns by IP address
- `ip_dataset_access_total` - IP-to-dataset access correlation
- `geographic_requests_total` - Geographic request distribution
- `popular_endpoints_total` - Most used application endpoints

## 🔒 **Privacy & Security Features**

- **IP Privacy**: IP addresses can be hashed for privacy in long-term storage
- **Geographic Aggregation**: Location data aggregated to country/region level  
- **Configurable Retention**: Different retention periods for sensitive vs aggregate data
- **Enhanced Alerting**: Alerts for unusual dataset access patterns or suspicious IP activity

The enhanced monitoring provides comprehensive visibility into both your application performance and user behavior patterns while 
maintaining appropriate privacy controls for sensitive military data analysis environments.
